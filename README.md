        \____________________________/     THE GAME

 
           There are millions of games that consume
           humankind's attention.  You can shoot things,
           drive cars, fly planes, even have your own
           farm.  But there is one game the surpasses
           all of the rest...

           Introducing Boxes: The Game.  Your box can
           be whatever you want it to be.  A box.  A
           spaceship.  A box.  A train station.  A box.
           A nuclear reactor.  A box.  Someone who will
           be your friend.  A box.  The only limit is
           your imagination.

           You choose how the boxes will interact.
           Will they be friends or foes?  Will they do
           anything at all?  This strange new world is
           yours to explore.
